- Let's setup this monorepo, which has presumably just been initialized.
- Start by exploring the structure of this monorepo (Including hidden files & dirs) and reading all the lines of all the files you encounter.
- Run `pnpm install` from the monorepo's root
- Then, ask the user how they would like to proceed, like whether they need to clone or initialize any subrepos, engage in planning with you, etc.
- If the user says they need to clone a subrepo, tell the user to use the `/subrepo-new` command in Claude Code. DO NOT clone it for them.

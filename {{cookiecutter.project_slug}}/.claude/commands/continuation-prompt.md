$ARGUMENTS

I need to restart our chat session. Please give me a prompt I can copy & paste back to you in the next chat, that you will be able to pickup where we left off.

Ensure your continuation prompt is comprehensive, including all relevant paths, progress, docs, exa, design patterns, principals, original instructions, etc.

Your prompt should be extensive so that no mistakes of ignorance are made in the next work-session.

Respond with only the prompt and nothing else.
